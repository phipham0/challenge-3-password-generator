# Challenge 3: Password Generator

## Description

This project is a webpage that is displaying a password generator. A big red button is in the center of the screen, and when it is clicked, a series of prompts appears and asks the user what their
requirements are for the password. The first prompt asks the user the length of the password. It also has validations in place. If the user enters a number outside of the 8 to 128 range, then they are asked
to enter a number again. After the length, the user is asked a series of character types that are to be included in the password. These include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The character types also have validation. If there are zero character types selected, the user will be prompted to input their character types again. In the end, the password is generated
at the center of the screen.

This project was the most fun for me yet. I find myself to be a more logical person, and I feel like javascript is the best way to represent that out of CSS and HTML. Because of this,
I was really motivated to work through the logic of the validations using condition statements and functions. I haven't worked with prompts, confirms, and alerts before, so this was a 
great learning experience. Overall, this was a fun project, isolating my focus on purely javascript and creating the logic of the website.

## Usage

There are three interactive links in the Navigation Bar in the upper right corner. Each link, About Me, My Work, and Contact Me,
will send the user down the webpage to more information. Also, in the work section, there are two clickable cards/links that will send you to that appropriate project.
At the end of the page, there are links for my personal information. For the rest of the page, the text can be read and the webpage can be scrolled through.
